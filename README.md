# Sentiment-Analysis

In this Project I have perfromed sentimental anlaysis on Amazon customer reviews data. Project is need of an hour as social media platforms gave powers to potential customers to talk about the product what they like or not . "Some say I don't like the texture of the cream I bought last week" and how these reviews effects other in common clusters.
So we came up with an idea to analyze whether good rating means product is doing great and bad rating means its going to obsolete.

When started working on it  I used Natural Language Processing tools to perform feature selections, orientiation of public opinion. To conduct this I have made some test cases :

Punctuaiton vs Polarity : Does people with good writting skills effect the polarity.
Sentiment Routine vs Trends

For Visualization : matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used 
For Cleaning  : Regex & NLTk for cleaning and get data in refined form and Used various Natural Language processing packages(TextBlob, Spacy) to check polarity,subjectivity, objectivity scores 



Result Outcomes :

Most of the cases Rating and polarity varies : Customer gave rating as 4 while subjectivity score and polarity comes out to be Negative.

This project helped us in dealing with the feedback from customers and provide future goals to find positive and negative themes that leverage statistical significance of the data to make more relevant ,legal claims
